# 🏥 Medical Appointment Booking Agent (LLM + MCP)

A conversational **medical appointment assistant** that uses a **Large Language Model (Claude)** for intent extraction and a **deterministic Python backend** for reliable execution.

This project demonstrates how LLMs can be safely integrated into real systems by clearly separating **understanding (LLM)** from **execution (backend logic)**.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

The agent allows users to interact in natural language to perform medical appointment–related tasks.

### 👤 Patient Capabilities
- Book medical appointments with doctors
- Provide missing details through follow-up questions
- Receive booking confirmation via email
- Retrieve appointment details using appointment ID

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Capabilities
- View daily schedules for a specific date
- Receive daily schedules via email

## 🧠 Core Design Principle

> **The LLM is used only for intent and data extraction.  
All actions are executed deterministically by backend logic.**

This prevents hallucinations, ensures correctness, and keeps the system predictable and testable.
